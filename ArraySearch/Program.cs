//Given an array, arr of n integers, and an integer element x, find whether element x is present in the array. Return the index of the first occurrence of x in the array, or -1 if it doesn't exist.

//Examples:

//Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3
//Output: 2
//Explanation: There is one test case with array as [1, 2, 3 4] and element to be searched as 3.Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.
//Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], x = 5
//Output: 4
//Explanation: For array[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the element to be searched is 5 and it is at index 4.So, the output is 4.
